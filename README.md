# Yayoi Demography
Demographic Response to the introduction of rice farming in the Yayoi period

## Possible Venues
QSR? JAS? Scientific Reports? Nature Comms?

## Core Ideas

* Literature review on prehistoric demography, lack of detailed trends within the Yayoi period, and the curse of ceramic chronology
* Literature reiew on dispersal of farming and different regional responses  (mostly Fujio's stuff)
* C14Db intro and spatial demography
* Limitations of existing approaches based on SPDs
* Discuss the issue of spatial averaging and non-stationarity
* Introduce Gaussian Process Regression
* Possible Nonstationary Gaussian Process Regression (NGPR - see [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BayesNSGP/index.html)
* Simulation study (supplementary materials)

## Current Status
- [] Explore GP model with exponential growth
- [] Explore NSGP model with exponential growth
- [] Setup main pipeline for analysis on observed data
- [] Consider split into two periods?
- [] Basic graphs
