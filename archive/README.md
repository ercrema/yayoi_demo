# Yayoi Demography
Demographic Response to the introduction of rice farming in the Yayoi period

## Possible Venues
QSR? JAS? Scientific Reports? Nature Comms?

## Core Ideas

* Literature review on prehistoric demography, lack of detailed trends within the Yayoi period, and the curse of ceramic chronology
* Literature reiew on dispersal of farming and different regional responses  (mostly Fujio's stuff)
* C14Db intro and spatial demography
* Limitations of existing approaches based on SPDs
* Discuss the issue of spatial averaging and non-stationarity
* Conditional Autoregressive Model with prefectures as spatial units (maybe)
* Hierarchichal Model with Regional Exponential model and offset timewindow between estimated start of farming and 500/1000 yrs.
